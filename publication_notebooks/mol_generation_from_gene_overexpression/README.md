# Molecular generation from over-expression profiles 
Collection of scripts to reproduce all results from molecular generation experiments conditioned on gene over-expression profiles, including profile projections, GAN inference, nearest neighbors computations, scaffold enrichment analyses and plots generation from publication Figures 3 and 4, Supplementary Figure 2, 5 and 6, and Supplementary Table 1.  Notebooks should be run sequentially as indicated by the digit prefix. All output files will be stored in the results folder.
